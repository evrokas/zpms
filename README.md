Zeus Patient Management System

## Regression tests

Run before every update to the live app:

```sh
bin/run_tests.sh
```

Static PHP/JS/CSS/template consistency checks, then patient/appointment/
auth/file-upload functional tests driven over real HTTP against a
dedicated, disposable test database — never the live one. See
`tests/README.md` for one-time setup and the safety design.

## Roles and permissions

Staff accounts (the `users` table) are authorized via a standard
role-based model: `permissions` (the fixed set of things the app actually
checks — `patients-view-list`, `appointment-edit`, etc.), `roles` (named,
assignable bundles like `power-user`), `role_permissions` (which
permissions a role grants), and `user_roles` (which roles a user has).
See `web/rbac.php`'s own docblock for the full design, including two real
bugs in the previous system this replaced — most importantly, every
permission check silently passed for any logged-in user regardless of
role, so this isn't just a schema cleanup.

**Admin UI:** list/add/edit/delete for users and all four RBAC tables
lives at `/admin/{entity}` (`entity` is `users`, `permissions`, `roles`,
`role_permissions`, or `user_roles`) — linked from Settings under "User &
Role Management" for anyone who can see it. Gated behind its own
`users-manage` permission, deliberately **not** granted to `power-user` by
default (see `ZPMS_PERM_USERS_MANAGE`'s comment in `web/rbac.php`): this
page can create a new `is_superuser` role and assign it to any account,
including its own operator's, so treat it as more sensitive than the
`settings-manage`-gated Clinics/Doctors pages. Grant it explicitly (via
the User Roles page itself, or `user_rolesClassEx::assignRole(...)`
directly) to whichever accounts should have it — an `is_superuser` account
(the seeded `administrator` role) always has it implicitly and needs no
explicit grant. One generic engine (`web/admin_crud.php`) drives all five
entities from a metadata array rather than five near-duplicated pages;
see that file's own docblock for the shape.

**Deploying this for the first time / to a server still on the old
scheme:** the new tables must exist before the app code that uses them
does, and every existing account needs an actual `user_roles` row before
it can pass any permission check again (it can still log in either way —
only fine-grained permission checks are affected, not authentication
itself):

```sh
# 1. Generate + load the new tables (same steps your normal deploy
#    already runs for any schema change in this app — there's no
#    migration runner, so this part is manual):
cd web/classes
php ../core/maker/maker.php spill:class:all
php ../core/maker/maker.php update:bootstrap
php ../core/maker/maker.php spill:sql:all
mysql -u <user> -p <db> < sql/permissions.sql
mysql -u <user> -p <db> < sql/roles.sql
mysql -u <user> -p <db> < sql/role_permissions.sql
mysql -u <user> -p <db> < sql/user_roles.sql

# 2. Preview the migration (writes nothing):
cd ../..
php bin/migrate_roles.php --dry-run

# 3. Apply it -- seeds permissions/roles/role_permissions and transfers
#    every user's existing users.roles value into a user_roles row:
php bin/migrate_roles.php --yes
```

`bin/migrate_roles.php --dry-run` prints exactly what it would do,
including a warning for any account whose legacy `roles` value doesn't
match a known role name (nothing is ever silently dropped — see the
script's own header comment). It's idempotent, so re-running it after
fixing something it flagged is safe.

## Backups

`bin/backup.sh`, run nightly via cron/systemd (reference configs:
`deploy/zpms-backup.cron`, `deploy/zpms-backup.timer`/`.service` — install
one or the other manually, neither is auto-applied by anything in this
repo), takes a consistent MySQL dump (`mysqldump --single-transaction`, so
InnoDB doesn't need locking for a consistent snapshot) and hardlinks
`web/files/` (the app's upload/library store — e.g. appointment
attachments) alongside it, then ships both off-site via rsync
over SSH using rotating `--link-dest` generations: `daily/` (kept 14 by
default), promoted into `weekly/` (8) and `monthly/` (12) using the first
generation of each new ISO week/month, so a missed cron night never leaves
a permanent gap in a tier. An unchanged file costs zero extra network/disk
on every run after the first. `web/cache/` (ephemeral QR codes, purged
every request) is excluded.

**GDPR erasure vs. retention.** The newest generation always reflects
current state — a deleted patient/record is simply absent from the next
night's dump. Older, already-published generations still contain it
(retention *expiry*, not active scrubbing) since `--link-dest` hardlinks
preserve content regardless of what happens on the primary afterward. With
the default 14/8/12 tiers, a record deleted right after a monthly snapshot
was promoted can remain recoverable from that monthly generation for up to
~13 months before it ages out — lower `BACKUP_KEEP_MONTHLY` in
`backup.conf` if your erasure obligations need a tighter bound.

**Setup:**
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/zpms
sudo cp deploy/backup.conf.example /etc/zpms/backup.conf
sudo $EDITOR /etc/zpms/backup.conf
sudo chmod 600 /etc/zpms/backup.conf
```
See `deploy/backup.conf.example` for every variable. Credentials for
`mysqldump`/`mysql` are read from this app's own `config/db.php` — never
placed on the command line or in an environment variable, both of which
leak to `ps`/shell history/`/proc` — instead handed to the MySQL client
tools via a temporary, mode-600 `--defaults-extra-file` that's deleted the
moment the script exits.

Each run writes `web/files/logs/backup_status.json` (last run time,
success/failure), surfaced read-only on the admin **Backups** page
(`/apps/backup`) — that page doesn't trigger backups itself, it just shows
whether last night's run succeeded.

**Restoring:**
```sh
bin/restore.sh --list
bin/restore.sh daily/2026-08-08T020000Z
```
Fetches the chosen generation, verifies the dump loads cleanly into a
throwaway scratch database, and restores `web/files/`. It deliberately
does **not** auto-import the dump into your live database — overwriting a
live production database automatically is a much higher-consequence
action than restoring files, so the verified dump is left in place with
the exact `mysql ... < zpms.sql` command printed for you to run manually
against whichever database you choose.
